CLASSIFICATION OF HAND-WRITING DIGITS USING SVM

The MNIST dataset is a database of handwritten digits. The data source is from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ . After downloading the file, you can see each line of the file represents an image of size 28 × 28 by a vector of length 784, with each feature specifying a grayscale pixel value. The first column contains the labels of the digits, 0–9, the next 28*28 columns represent the whole image, and so on.
